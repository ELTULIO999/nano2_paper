This paper carries out the Tiny Tapeout initiative with 4 verilog designs,() 
with the intention to fully utilize and comprehend this open-source design 
flow for chip design/manufacturing and to leave proper documentation for future 
students to take advantages of this new and innovative processes to enter in the 
semiconductor realm.
Two students of the Electronics Engineering department at Universidad del Valle De Guatemala were 
fortunate to attend the "2023 IEEE EDS summer School R9" where the Tiny Tapeout workshop was held and 
where the first steps of this project were taken. The opportunity to learn from this 
workshop was invaluable and the knowledge gained was engough to actualy carry out the Tiny Tapeout
initiative at Universidad del Valle De Guatemala.
four designs were submitted on the 5th of september 2023, after taking the necessary steps to get the tools and the 
design flow working. The Tiny Tapeout verifications were done and on the 10th of october 2023 our four designs were approved for 
manufacturing, the expected date for delivery 15th of febuarry 2024.
