This paper carries out the Tiny Tapeout initiative with 4 verilog designs,() 
with the intention to fully utilize and comprehend this open-source design 
flow for chip design/manufacturing and to leave proper documentation for future 
students to take advantages of this new and innovative processes to enter in the 
semiconductor realm.
Two students of the Electrical Engineering faculty were fortunate to attend the 
"2023 IEEE EDS summer School R9" where the Tiny Tapeout workshop was held and 
where the first steps of this project were taken. The opportunity to learn from this 
workshop was invaluable and the knowledge gained was engough to actualy carry out the Tiny Tapeout
initiative at La Universidad del valle De Guatemala.
After taking the necessary steps to get the tools and the design flow working, the submissions
of our 4 designs were made. The delivery date for the chip that would have our four design was 
set for the 15th of febuarry 2024.
