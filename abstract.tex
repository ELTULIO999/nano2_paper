This paper carries out the Tiny Tapeout initiative with 4 verilog designs,
with the intention to fully utilize and comprehend this open-source design 
flow for chip design/manufacturing and to leave proper documentation for future 
students to take advantage of this new and innovative process to enter in the 
semiconductor realm.
Two students of the Electronics Engineering department at Universidad del Valle De Guatemala were 
fortunate to attend the "2023 IEEE EDS summer School R9" where the Tiny Tapeout workshop was 
held and where the first steps of this project were taken. The opportunity to learn from this 
workshop was invaluable and the knowledge gained was enough to actually carry out the 
Tiny Tapeout initiative at Universidad del Valle De Guatemala. Four designs were submitted 
on the September 5th 2023, after taking the necessary steps to get the tools and the 
design flow working. After submission the necessary verifications were made by the 
Tiny Tapeout team, on October 10th 2023 our four designs were approved for manufacturing 
and were sent to efabless for fabrication, the expected date for delivery 15th of February 2024. 
The final Tiny Tapeout 04 project had 143 submissions from 30 different countries, a total cell 
count of 82126 cells and a total area of die of 6 mm x 7.4 mm.
