The development of four Verilog designs for Tiny Tapeout 04 submission encompassed a multistage path for delay measurement, an ASCII text printer circuit, the implementation of the Pong game, and a pulse-width modulation generator. Approval for these designs was granted on October 10th, 2023. For the Tiny Tapeout 04 submission, 143 projects were submitted from over 30 countries. The total build time amounted to 8.6 hours, utilizing a total of 82,126 cells. The top 10 tags associated with the projects included testing, timing, experiments, games, clocks, PWM, serial communication, VGA, and music implementation. To comprehensively understand the tool's limitations, additional tests on the physical chip are imperative. The overarching goal of the Tiny Tape Out initiative is to educate and offer students the opportunity to navigate the entire design process, from creation to manufacturing, with minimal prior knowledge in this field.
