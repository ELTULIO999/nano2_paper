\subsection{Software installation for synthesis verifications}

To verify that both logical and physical synthesis align with the Verilog files, the installation of an  open-source integrated circuit design flow called OpenLane was performed. To use it, a virtual machine with Ubuntu 22 was set up, and the necessary prerequisites, including Python 3, git, make, and Docker, were installed. The GitHub repository containing OpenLane was cloned and compiled. It was confirmed that OpenLane operated correctly by synthesizing a 4-bit adder.

\subsection{GDS final design submission for manufacturing}

In the final submission phase of the GDS design for 
manufacturing, a series of crucial steps were undertaken to ensure the
integrity and accuracy of the delivered information. First a comprehensive 
review of all relevant repositories was conducted with the aim of identifying
and rectifying any errors that may have existed in their execution. Subsequently
the provided form by Latin Practice was completed, requiring essential 
details about the repositories, including author names and direct links 
to the referred repositories. It is noteworthy that this form-filling 
process was rigorously carried out before the stipulated deadline, which 
was September 5th. These steps were taken to ensure the consistency and 
precision of the information provided in this critical stage of the GDS 
design project. In figures\ \ref*{fig:pwm_verified},\ \ref*{fig:pong_verified},
\ \ref*{fig:ascii_verified}, and\ \ref*{fig:delay_verified} the verification 
process of the four design sent to manufacture is shown to be successful.

\subsection{Technology transfer for the Tiny Tapeout chip design flow}

The true purpose behind this paper is to push the boundaries of understanding the semiconductor fabrication field at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. The proper documentation of the knowledge acquired by all the members that were involved on this work is essential for future students. Therefore, Video tutorials and documents were made for students to replicate the Tiny tapeout program to take any design from a fully digital verilog implemented circuit all the way to a physical integrated circuit.
