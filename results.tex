In this section, we present the final results for each individual verilog 
filed we have submitted to the Tiny Tapeout initiative. The following figures 
Show our verilog designs in a phisical layout, and the Table\ \ref{tab:PorcentUtil} show 
a Porcentage utilize in length of waver per circuit.



\subsection{Multy stage path for delay measurements}

The multy stage path was submitted with no errors, and the final layout is shown in figure\ \ref{fig:delay_Layout}. The layout was designed to be as compact as possible, and the final area was 0.63\% (as showed in Table\ \ref*{tab:PorcentUtil}) of the total area of the chip.
